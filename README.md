# Flighty

Flighty is an app that compiles all the secret flight deals from around the web by pooling RSS feeds. The hard work is already done by the experts, the user can simply browse the latest deals and error fares then click the links to view details and book.

Flighty is still very much under development and considered unstable!! At this stage it is working in Android Studio ONLY. 

To use: clone or download the ZIP file and open with Android Studio. 

Flighty uses Retrofit, SimpleXML and Jsoup. 

In future releases users will be able to set a wish-list of destinations using keyword searches, and be notified when a relevant fare is posted.
